BUILDING THServer
-----------------
   A. WITHOUT ACCESS TO COMCAST REPO
   ---------------------------------
   1. If you are not having access to comcast repo, each component including server needs to be build manually.

        i.  Refer the links provided above to download the required components.

        ii. To build openCV use following set of commands:

                NOTE: 1. All REQUIRED PACKAGES(mentioned in the link above) should be built before building opencv
                      2. For X264 compatibility, while building ffmpeg enable libx264.The procedure for the same can be found in the link
                         (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/How%20to%20quickly%20compile%20FFmpeg%20with%20libx264%20(x264%2C%20H.264))

                #mkdir build
                #cd build
                #cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local  -DWITH_GTK=ON -DENABLE_NEON=ON -DSOFTFP=OFF -DWITH_IPP=OFF ..
                #make
                #make install

        iii. To build cjson use the following set of commands:

                #mkdir build
                #cd build
                #cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
                #make
                #make install

        iv.  To build THServer use the following set of commands:

                #cd server
                #export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path_to_pkg_config_file>
                #make

   2. THServer executable is build under THServer directory.

   B.WITH ACCESS TO COMCAST REPO
   -----------------------------

   1. Get Build.sh from the comcast repo (PATH:master/video-analytics/tets-harness/Phase-II/server) to a directory on a the local system.

   2. Run the Build.sh.

    NOTE: All REQUIRED PACKAGES(mentioned in the link above) for opencv should be built before running Build.sh.

	You can configure the following parameter in Build.sh
	    a. DOWNLOAD_COMPONENTS -: if "yes" downloads the components from the repo.
	    b. BUILD_OPENCV -: if "yes" builds the opencv.
	    c. BUILD_CJSON  -: if "yes" builds the CJSON.
	    d. BUILD_THSERVER -: if "yes" builds the THServer.

   3. The executable THServer and depended libraries are copied to "./build/lib".

RUNNING THServer
----------------

   1. ./THServer <path_to_config_file>

   2. THServerConfig.txt has the following configurable parameters:
        
        a. port -> port on which the server listens for the incoming requests.
        b. frame_limit -> specifically for camera feed, determine the number of frames to be written to a file.
        c. source_video_dir -> specifically for file feed, determines the directory which contains the source video.
        d. output_processed_video -> to enable output processed video.
        e. support_imshow -> to enable the live processed frame display.
	f. output_video_dir -> Directory to which processed videos and metadata for a particular clients is saved.
	g. resize_frame -> to enable frame resizing.

        NOTE:The parameter name should same as mentioned above in the config file.
